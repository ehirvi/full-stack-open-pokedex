Our team is working on an application with Go. For linting we will use a very popular library "golangci-lint" that utilizes several linters underneath for styling, code quality as well as bugs and errors. Another option would be to also use "gosec" which checks for security problems.
For testing we will use Go language's own testing library, similar to how Node.js has its own test runner. Alternatively if we want more features and need more complicated tests we can use a testing library called "testify" and for HTTP request testing "httpexpect".
Since Go is a compiled language, we need to build the source code into an executable before running our app. Thankfully it is as simple as running `go build` in the app folder.

Some alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions are CircleCI, Drone CI and Gitlab CI/CD (cloud or self-hosted). On top of these it seems that almost every cloud provider has their own CI/CD solution, albeit more primitive in functionality. For our 6 developer project, I think a cloud-based GitHub Actions or Gitlab CI/CD would be a good fit since there is no need for a lot of complexity and we want deploy quickly instead of learning a tool that many consider outdated and overly complex (Jenkins). Once our application starts growing in features and we need to scale up the process, a cloud-hosted option might become too expensive so hosting locally will likely be a better choice. For that situation the self-hosted Gitlab service might work the best.
